# Golden-Retriever
A fairly small mod of Golden Sun (goes up to Vault) for April Fools.  In this strange universe, Vale is a town filled with dogs and it's strange influence only continues to spread after the eruption of Mt. Aleph. 

Features:
- Dogs
- "Fun Dog Facts" and other altered book dialogue throughout Vale and Vault
- Minor changes to enemy encounters up to Vault. Battles aren't more difficult but the changes are enough to be noticeable.
- Did I mention dogs?
